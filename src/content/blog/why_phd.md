description: A reflection on why I decided to pursue a PhD a year into the program.

Hi! My name is Jessica, and I am currently a PhD student studying Operations Management at NYU Stern School of Business. I wanted to write this article to give a thorough review on why I ended up here primarily for two reasons 1. Give you all (the reader!) a good reference if you’re making this same decision 2. Be able to remind myself what it’s all for when I’m feeling less motivated. Committing myself to a PhD was no easy decision— 5+ years of hard work, late hours, low pay, and constant failures- but for me, a year in, I believe it was the right decision.

To provide some background, I was born in the states, went to a public non-specialized high school in Virginia and attended Columbia University studying operations research. My father is a mathematics professor at a university, so growing up I have always been under the influence of an academic. I had started considering a PhD during high school, although at that point I was more interested in studying computational biology. After learning more about operations research while entering Columbia, I realized that it was a field where I could use the quantitative methodologies and social-good driven motivations that I enjoyed to solve a broader set of interesting questions across industries. After much consideration, I committed myself to the major- and found myself surrounded by others who had a similar experience in changing from other fields. I also minored in economics and computer science, becoming fascinated by understanding how consumers, firms and the government interact in the economy to reach good outcomes and how we can use computational power to automate and solve hard problems.

Through side projects and coursework, I realized I had a love for building technological products, so I pursued software engineering internships and random startup ideas through my summers and semesters in college. My experiences varied from working for the federal government, startups, big tech, and medium sized tech, where I had many positive learning experiences and also exposed me to all sorts of problems that existed in industry. Through this, my intention to pursue a PhD persisted, and although I loved working in tech, there were a few aspects that felt I’d miss by not giving the PhD a shot. I felt as though I could be happy for a few years in a cushy tech job but eventually feel a lack of satisfaction and ambition and get hit by the regret of missing out on grad school. Especially since a software engineering job had little to do with what I wanted to study long term, it felt that even a short trip into industry post-grad would cause me to get stuck.

In Fall 2023, I took the leap and took my heaviest courseload to prepare myself for the PhD life. I took the GRE and prepared my materials to apply for matriculation in 2024. Obviously writing my Statement of Purpose caused me to deeply reflect on my motivations and goals of applying. Although not all of this article made it to text of the application itself, I'll try to describe where my head was/still is at on what were the most important aspects in my career!

## Impact - global and local

The main reason for my decision to do a PhD came down to the sort of impact that I wanted to have in my life. For me, it has been important for me to position myself in a career where I can create social impact and positively affect many people. I think being an academic comes down to two levels of social impact— at the level of global research collaboration and institutional influence. Being able to have this sort of dual objective in my job is really exciting to me— to be committed to furthering the knowledge in the world and educating the next generation.

Research should be the center of every PhD students goals and motivations. All other aspects are just for extra. I started research in high school, working on mathematical modeling questions in the natural and biological sciences. Although I didn't do anything incredible, I loved the idea of producing something completely original towards the goal of understanding the world. At Columbia, I was able to work with three different professors, across departments, and

I love that I have control over what I'm studying and working on. In industry, there are interesting problems for sure, but everything is controlled by "business needs". There's no motivation for a business to pursue a problem that doesn't have a clear return on investment. In academia, this is not the case, even at the business school level.

## Operations — the problem and the solution

Obviously, if I'm going to study something for the rest of my life, I really hope that I love it. As someone who gets excited about artificial intelligence and solving socially impactful problems, I realized that my passion was in applying AI and technology to help people especially in marginalized communities and

## Work and life style

I’d characterize the work and life style of a PhD student to be the same thing because to be honest there is not a lot of separation between the two. I'm the type of person where my brain is 100 My day-to-day basically follows a

1. Collaboration
2. Independence
3. Travel/breaks

## Job security & money

As my parents have told people that I had started my PhD, a lot of the initial reactions were along the lines of "Yeah, sorry the job market is rough" and "Was she not able to find anything else to do?". It makes me really sad that pursuing a PhD is seen as a "backup" or "last resort" in many people's eyes, where in fact for many of us it was a conscious and proud decision that we had made. Pursuing a PhD has come under a lot of fire, as a "waste of time" and eventually graduates will end up at the same jobs that they could've gotten without the degree.
