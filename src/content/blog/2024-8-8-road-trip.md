## South Dakota

South Dakota was such a fun state to drive through! Our first stop was through Sioux Falls, which has a lovely downtown. 📍The World's Only Corn Palace and 📍Wall Drug are fun stops along the highway, and the Badlands are an incredible landscape to see and for a short hike!

### Badlands NP

The whole loops take 2 hours to drive, due to a tight schedule we just stopped for the one trail. There's also a great lookout point right before hitting this area.

<b>🥾 [Notch Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/south-dakota/notch-trail)</b>, <i>1.5 miles, 127 ft</i><br>
There's a large parking lot for the Window, Door, and Notch trails, park towards the south end for the Notch trail. The trail is through and up the canyon, and ends at a vast overlook of the valley. There's also a point in the trail where you have to climb up a ladder!

🏠 Campground in the Black Hills

## Wyoming

🏠 Doyle Family Farm

A really incredible Airbnb experience!

### Grand Tetons NP

🏠 Signal Mountain Campground <br>
NPS-managed, so make sure to book 6 months in advance. Bears spotted pretty close.

📍 Signal Lake

<b>🥾 [Delta Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/wyoming/delta-lake-via-lupine-meadows-access) </b>, <i>7.4 miles, 2296 ft</i><br>

Not an official park-maintained trail, but very popular. Incline is pretty steep towards the end, and the trail involves crossing a few rock fields. The glacial lake at the top is spectacular, bring a suit to jump in!

<b>🥾 [Jenny Lake](https://www.alltrails.com/ar/trail/us/wyoming/inspiration-point-via-jenny-lake-boat-shuttle) </b>, <i>1.8 miles, 419 ft</i><br>

There's a boat shuttle close to the parking that takes you to the traihead for Inspiration Point, Hidden Falls, and Cascade Canyon. We opted to take the ferry over, just go up to Hidden Falls and stop for a quick dip on the hike back.

### Yellowstone NP

🏠 Grant Village Campground <br>
Nothing really special about this one, just a place to sleep. Campsites are pretty tightly packed.
